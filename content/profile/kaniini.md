Donâ€™t forget to delete this placeholder text ðŸ™ƒ

Here are some ideas of what you can tell your potential sponsors:
- [ ] Who are you, and where are you from?
- [ ] What are you working on?
- [ ] Why is their sponsorship important? How will you use the funds?

Hint: You can include images and emojis in your bio!
